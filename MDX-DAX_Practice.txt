- Quantity of Orders YTD = TOTALYTD(SUM('Sales'[OrderQty]), 'Sales'[OrderDate])

- CALENDER or CALENDERAUTO()
    - Calendar Table
    - Can be used to visualize data from each table using a single visual
    - Creates a dimension table that contains a list of dates - one for every day of the calender of fiscal years

    - CALENDARAUTO([FiscalYearEndMonth])
        bases the START and END date on the MINIMUM and MAXIMUM dates across the entire model
